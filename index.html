            <h3>Interests</h3>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>I love learning things; I just learned that someone who loves to learn things is known as a philomath.</li>
                    <li>I am passionate about cultural anthropology, which was my minor in undergrad, and being exposed to new cultures as it helps me grow as a person.</li>
                    <li>I collect vinyl records -- some old classics I grew up with like Queen and the Ramones, and newer releases from my favorite artists, such as Taylor Swift, Bring Me The Horizon, and My Chemical Romance, for example. I just think there is something special in the experience of listening to music in vinyl form.</li>
